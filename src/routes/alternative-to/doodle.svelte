<h2>MetaMeet is similar to other social planning apps like Doodle</h2>

<p>
  However we solve a slightly different use case to Doodle and differ in a few
  key ways.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    MetaMeet aims to be as simple and quick to use as possible in contrast to
    Doodle which was more features but might take longer to arrive at a time for
    your social.
  </li>
  <li>MetaMeet only allows you to agree a date to meet, not a time.</li>
  <li>
    MetaMeet provides real-time updates so you don't need to refresh the page!
  </li>
  <li>
    MetaMeet is not a mobile app, its a web app, but it still works great on
    mobile.
  </li>
</ul>
